# Cryptid-Dex
### App contest 2023

Our website prototype showcases our idea for a unique and engaging platform designed to bridge the gap between local businesses and their communities through the intriguing and mysterious world of North American Cryptids. This website, aptly named the Cryptid Dex will be an interactive addition to google business directories and an interactive way for businesses to connect with their audience/customers.

The Cryptid Dex will be built using a robust and modern tech stack. On the frontend, we're leveraging JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS. The user interface is built with React and Next.js, with Redux serving as the data store and Axios as the fetch utility.

The backend of the website is equally robust, with PostgreSQL managed through PGAdmin4 and Redis software. The Adonis framework serves as the middleware, with route testing performed through Insomnia.

The core functionality of the website allows businesses to sign up and choose a virtual cryptid mascot from our database, based on availability. Each cryptid is represented by an 8-bit styled illustration, adding a nostalgic and fun element to the user experience.

One of the key features of the Cryptid Dex is the integration with Google. This allows the chosen cryptid to be displayed on the official Google links of the business. Furthermore, businesses can conveniently import the cryptid illustrations from our API route to display on their own websites.

The ultimate goal of the Cryptid Dex is to connect interesting mythologies with local small businesses, creating a unique and engaging experience for the community. This website prototype is not just a business tool, but a creative platform that brings folklore and local businesses together in a fun and interactive way.
