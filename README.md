Unveil the enchantment lurking just around the corner with CryptiDex: Your local business companion! Picture this: you stroll through your town, heading to your favorite local haunts. As you enter the business, you spot a mysterious QR code waiting to be scanned. You pull out your phone, scan it, and voilà! A unique cryptid creature materializes in your CryptiDex app, tied to that specific place.

But that's just the beginning of your adventure! Each time you revisit the same place and scan the code, your cryptid companion grows bigger and even acquires special items to enhance its abilities. It's like nurturing a collection of living trading cards that thrive with your support.

The magic doesn't stop there. Your cryptid companions come in all shapes and sizes, each with its own fascinating lore. You'll find yourself on a quest to visit every participating local restaurant and shop to uncover the diverse range of cryptids hiding in your town.

With CryptiDex, you're not just collecting creatures – you're supporting your local economy. As you explore the businesses in your community, you're contributing to their success and growth. You become an integral part of the local fabric, boosting the vitality of your neighborhood.


CryptiDex will be built using a robust and modern tech stack. On the frontend, we're leveraging JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS. The user interface is built with React and Next.js, with Redux serving as the data store and Axios as the fetch utility.

The backend of the website is equally robust, with PostgreSQL managed through PGAdmin4 and Redis software. The Adonis framework serves as the middleware, with route testing performed through Insomnia.

The core functionality of the website allows businesses to sign up and choose a virtual cryptid mascot from our database, based on availability. Each cryptid is represented by an 8-bit styled illustration, adding a nostalgic and fun element to the user experience.

The ultimate goal of the CryptiDex is to connect interesting mythologies with local small businesses, creating a unique and engaging experience for the community. This website prototype is not just a business tool, but a creative platform that brings folklore and local businesses together in a fun and interactive way.
